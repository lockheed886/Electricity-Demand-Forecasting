Electricity Demand Forecasting
Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand using historical electricity consumption and weather data. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and regression modeling for prediction.

Repository Structure
Each task is organized into separate folders:

ðŸ“‚ Data_Loading/

Scripts to scan and load electricity and weather data from multiple files.
Handles file format validation and encoding issues.
ðŸ“‚ Data_Preprocessing/

Data cleaning: handling missing values, data type conversions, and duplicate removal.
Feature engineering: creating time-based features and standardizing numerical data.
ðŸ“‚ EDA/

Statistical analysis and visualization of electricity demand.
Time series analysis, correlation heatmaps, and distribution plots.
ðŸ“‚ Outlier_Detection/

Implementation of IQR and Z-score methods for detecting anomalies.
Strategies for handling outliers (removal, transformation, or capping).
ðŸ“‚ Regression_Modeling/

Feature selection and splitting data into training and testing sets.
Model development using Linear Regression (or other techniques).
Model evaluation using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².

Installation & Dependencies:
To run this project, install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels

How to Run
1)Clone this repository:
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Electricity-Demand-Forecasting.git
2) Navigate to a specific folder and execute the scripts in sequence.

3) Review generated outputs such as cleaned datasets, visualizations, and model predictions.

Results & Insights:
Identified key trends and seasonal patterns in electricity demand.
Built a predictive model to forecast demand based on time-based and weather-related features.
